>Based on these articles, what would an ideal file structure look like for a React project, in your opinion?

A: Based on the articles, one thing is clear: there is no one way, or even right way to structure a project. However, there are some good ideas to follow. Personally I think working with base structure and modifying it based on the type of project and/or the size of the project is probably the best approach. Alexis Mangin probably has the best approach by using the same structure for each project. As I said before, I still think because of complexities, modularity and flexibility will probably play a part in modifying the structure that's chosen. Here is a link that takes another approach which I find intuitive. Again, based on the project, this might not be the best, but it's simple to understand.

Below is something I would probably use as my base to start:

* /src
 * /actions
   * ButtonActions.js
   * FormActions.js
 * /components
   * Header.js
   * Sidebar.js
   * NavBar.js
   * Register.js
   * User.js
   * UserProfile.js
   * UserAccount.js
 * /containers
   * App.js
   * Command.js
   * Index.js
   * User.js
 * /styles
   * main.css
   * header.css
   * sidebar.css
   * navbar.css
   * form.css
